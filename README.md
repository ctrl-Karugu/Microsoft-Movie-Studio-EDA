# **Microsoft Movie Studio EDA** ([Femi Kamau](https://github.com/ctrl-Karugu))

> This project is a part of the [Data Science (DSF-FT) Course](https://moringaschool.com/courses/data-science-course/) at [Moringa School](https://moringaschool.com/). The full project description can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4).

## Overview

* A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

---

### 1. Business Problem

* Microsoft has decided to enter the original video content scene by creating a new movie studio. However, they don't know anything about creating movies. In order to solve this problem, the analysis shall be centered around answering the following question:

   > #### What types of films are currently performing the best at the box office?

* According to this [Holywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/what-is-profitable-movie-ever-1269879/) article, we see that the metric used to determine performance of a movie at the box office may vary. Therefore, it is important to clarify that within this analysis, **the metric that shall be used to determine the success of a movie will be the return on investment (ROI)**. ROI is an important performance measure used by businesses to evaluate the profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments.

* In order to further understand the types of movies that are currently performing the best at the box office, this analysis will look into the impact following features have on the ROI:

  * Genre

  * Runtime (Length)

  * Director(s) & Writer(s)

  * Cast

  * Gross Revenue

  * Rating

  * Production Budget

---

### 2. Data Understanding

* Describe the data being used for this project.

Questions to consider:

* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?

---

### 3. Methods

* Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

Questions to consider:

* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?

---

### 4. Results

* Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

Questions to consider:

* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?

---

### 5. Conclusions

* Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

Questions to consider:

* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
